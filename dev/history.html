        <h1>History of Sudoku</h1>
        <pre>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a
9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the
rid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle
setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
French newspapers featured variations of the puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared
since 1979 in puzzle books under the name Number Place. However, the modern Sudoku only started to
become mainstream in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning "single number".
It first appeared in a US newspaper and then The Times (UK) in 2004, from the efforts of Wayne Gould, who
devised a computer program to rapidly produce distinct puzzles.

Number puzzles appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting
with removing numbers from magic squares. Le Siècle, a Paris daily, published a partially completed 9×9 magic
square with 3×3 subsquares on November 19, 1892. It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit
numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column
and subsquare added up to the same number.
