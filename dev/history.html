            <h1>History of Sudoku</h1>
            <pre>Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a
9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the
rid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle
setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
French newspapers featured variations of the puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared
since 1979 in puzzle books under the name Number Place. However, the modern Sudoku only started to
become mainstream in 1986 by the Japanese puzzle company Nikoli, under the name Sudoku, meaning "single number".
It first appeared in a US newspaper and then The Times (UK) in 2004, from the efforts of Wayne Gould, who
devised a computer program to rapidly produce distinct puzzles.

Number puzzles appeared in newspapers in the late 19th century, when French puzzle setters began experimenting
with removing numbers from magic squares. Le Siècle, a Paris daily, published a partially completed 9×9 magic
square with 3×3 subsquares on November 19, 1892. It was not a Sudoku because it contained double-digit
numbers and required arithmetic rather than logic to solve, but it shared key characteristics: each row, column
and subsquare added up to the same number.

The modern Sudoku was most likely designed anonymously by Howard Garns, a 74-year-old retired architect and freelance
puzzle constructor from Connersville, Indiana, and first published in 1979 by Dell Magazines as Number Place
(the earliest known examples of modern Sudoku). Garns's name was always present on the list of contributors in
issues of Dell Pencil Puzzles and Word Games that included Number Place, and was always absent from issues that did not.

The puzzle was introduced in Japan by Nikoli in the paper Monthly Nikolist in April 1984 as Sūji wa dokushin ni kagiru,
which also can be translated as "the digits must be single" or "the digits are limited to one occurrence". At a later date,
the name was abbreviated to Sudoku by Maki Kaji, taking only the first kanji of compound words to form a shorter version.
"Sudoku" is a registered trademark in Japan and the puzzle is generally referred to as Number Place or, more informally,
a portmanteau of the two words, Num(ber) Pla(ce). In 1986, Nikoli introduced two innovations: the number of givens was restricted
to no more than 32, and puzzles became "symmetrical" (meaning the givens were distributed in rotationally symmetric cells).

        <h2>Variants</h2>
        <pre><strong>Mini Sudoku</strong>
A variant named "Mini Sudoku" appears in the American newspaper USA Today and elsewhere, which is played on a 6×6 grid with
3×2 regions. The object is the same as that of standard Sudoku, but the puzzle only uses the numbers 1 through 6.

<strong>Killer Sudoku</strong>
The Killer Sudoku variant combines elements of Sudoku and Kakuro.

<strong>Alphabetical Sudoku</strong>
Alphabetical variations have emerged, sometimes called Wordoku; no functional difference exists in the puzzle unless the
letters spell something.

<strong>Kaodoku</strong>
Kaodokus use partially given smiley faces instead of digits. The smileys can have three possible shapes and three possible mouths,
for a total of nine unique combinations. In easy puzzles some full smileys may be given, but the harder ones only contain partial
cells with either a mouth or a shape. 

<strong>Hypersudoku</strong>
Hypersudoku is one of the most popular variants. It is published by newspapers and magazines around the world and is also known as
"NRC Sudoku", "Windoku", "Hyper-Sudoku", and "4 Square Sudoku". The layout is identical to a normal Sudoku, but with additional
interior squares defined in which the numbers 1 to 9 must appear. The solving algorithm is slightly different from the normal
Sudoku puzzles because of the emphasis on the overlapping squares.

<strong>Twin Sudoku</strong>
In Twin Sudoku two regular grids share a 3×3 box. This is one of many possible types of overlapping grids. The rules for each
individual grid are the same as in normal Sudoku, but the digits in the overlapping section are shared by each half.</pre>
